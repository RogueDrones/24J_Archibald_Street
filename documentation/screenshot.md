# Creating a Screenshot for the README

The README references a screenshot image at `public/screenshot.png`. You'll need to create this file to make the README look complete.

## Instructions

1. After you've deployed your application and added actual drone imagery, take a screenshot of the application in action.

2. Create a `public` folder in your project root if it doesn't already exist.

3. Save your screenshot as `screenshot.png` in the `public` folder.

4. The screenshot should ideally show:
   - The main drone image view
   - The timeline component
   - The map view
   - Any interactive elements that showcase the application's capabilities

## Temporary Solution

Until you have actual drone images, you can create a temporary placeholder:

1. Run the application locally with the sample data
2. Take a screenshot of the current state
3. Save it as `screenshot.png` in the `public` folder

This will provide a visual reference in your README while you're setting up the actual project data.

## Screenshot Guidelines

- **Resolution**: Aim for at least 1280x720 pixels
- **Format**: PNG format for better quality
- **Content**: Try to capture the most important features of the application
- **Aspect Ratio**: Landscape orientation works best for the README

Remember to update the screenshot once you have real drone imagery and project data in place.
